                    <h2>From Seed to Cup: The Journey of Coffee</h2>
                    <p>Coffee is more than a drink — it’s a story written across continents, cultures, and countless hands. Every sip begins with a seed planted in the soil of distant farms, nurtured by growers who dedicate their lives to cultivating flavor. At Steam & Stone, we believe it’s essential to understand that journey: from the highlands where coffee is born to the mug that warms your hands.</p>
                    <p>Coffee begins as a cherry on a tree, grown in what’s often called the “coffee belt” — regions near the equator with rich soil and consistent rainfall. Farmers carefully tend their crops, battling weather, pests, and fluctuating markets. For many smallholders, coffee isn’t just a livelihood; it’s a legacy passed down through generations.</p>

                    </figure>
                    <p>The final step of the journey is also the most personal. Brewing methods — pour-over, espresso, French press, cold brew — all bring out different dimensions of flavor. A careful hand, fresh beans, and attention to detail ensure the story of the bean is honored, from seed to cup.</p>
                    <p>Every coffee tells a story of connection: farmer to roaster, roaster to barista, barista to customer. By appreciating the journey, we celebrate not just a beverage, but a global community united by curiosity, care, and craft.</p>
